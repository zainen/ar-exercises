# Your code goes here ...

# 1. Borrowing and modifying the code from Exercise one, create 3 more stores:
#   * Surrey (annual_revenue of 224000, carries women's apparel only)
#   * Whistler (annual_revenue of 1900000 carries men's apparel only)
#   * Yaletown (annual_revenue of 430000 carries men's and women's apparel)
# 2. Using the `where` class method from Active Record, fetch (a collection of) only those stores that carry men's apparel. Assign the results to a variable `@mens_stores`.
# 3. Loop through each of these stores and output their name and annual revenue on each line.
# 4. Do another fetch but this time load stores that carry women's apparel and are generating less than $1M in annual revenue.
